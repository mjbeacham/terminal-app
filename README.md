# About

This is a simple seat reservation application, inspired by my school teacher fianc√© who hates that there are more kids than there are bus seats on any given day.

It allows a user to check available bus seats, reserve seats on the bus and issues ticket numbers that can be checked for seating confirmation.

# Installation

This app can be installed by clicking on "Code" at the top-right of this repository. Clone the repository or download it and then unzip. In the terminal run `./bus_seats.sh` to automatically install all dependencies and run the application.

Otherwise run `gem install bundler`.

Once all depencies have been installed you can run `bus_seats.rb` in your terminal to begin the application.
